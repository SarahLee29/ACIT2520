1.main is just to call functions
2.unzipped should be exiting before submmiting 

example for pngjs:

png compress image and have a small size
pngjs is a transform stream, taking huge raw bytes and transform to an array of pixels

call three times for every single image

read->transform->on function access all pixels 
this refers to png image
idx is the index of pixel, the start point is left top corner [0]
data is the array of all pixels
R
G
B
three vara represent one single pixel(the only place to be modified)
ingore the opacity line
after modify eh tiem inside png container, we need to package them back


bonus;
multithreading, import workerthredds
choose filter options
